# Tutorial for DNAnexus Platform (web)

All test samples and genome data are shared on our public DNAnexus project. You don't have to download any data for testing our pipeline on DNAnexus platform.

There are two methods to run our pipeline on DNAnexus.

1) [Building your own DX workflow from `atac.wdl` with dxWDL (CLI)](tutorial_dx_cli.md)
2) Using a pre-built DX workflow on our public DX project (Web UI)

This document describes instruction for the item 2).

1. Sign up for a [DNAnexus account](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/register).

2. Create a new [DX project](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects) by clicking on "+New Project" on the top left.

3. Move to one of the following workflow directories according to the platform you have chosen for your project (AWS or Azure). These DX workflows are pre-built with all parameters defined.

* [AWS test workflow](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/BKpvFg00VBPV975PgJ6Q03v6/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/test_ENCSR356KRQ_subsampled)
* [Azure test workflow](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/F6K911Q9xyfgJ36JFzv03Z5J/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/test_ENCSR356KRQ_subsampled)

4. Copy it to your project by right-clicking on the DX workflow `atac` and choose "Copy". 

5. Choose your project and create a folder for the test run by clicking on the "Folder+" icon.

6. Click on "Copy into this folder" on the bottom left.

7. Move to the target folder and click on the DX workflow `atac`.

9. Specify an output directory by clicking "Workflow Actions" on the top right. Click on "Set output folder" and choose an output folder.

10. Click on "Run as Analysis..." and you will be automatically redirected to the "Monitor" tab.

11. It will take about an hour. You will be able to find all outputs on your output folder. Final QC report (`qc.html`)/JSON (`qc.json`) will be found on it.

11. See full specification for [input JSON file](input.md).


## Extras for advanced users

1. DNAnexus allows only one copy of a workflow per project. The example workflow in the previous section is pre-built for the subsampled test sample [ENCSR356KRQ](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR356KRQ/) with all parameters defined already.

2. Copy one of the following workflows according to the platform you have chosen for your project (AWS or Azure).
* [AWS general](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/BKpvFg00VBPV975PgJ6Q03v6/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/general) without pre-defined reference genome.
* [AWS hg38](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/BKpvFg00VBPV975PgJ6Q03v6/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/hg38) with pre-defined hg38 reference genome.
* [AWS hg19](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/BKpvFg00VBPV975PgJ6Q03v6/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/hg19) with pre-defined hg19 reference genome.
* [AWS mm10](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/BKpvFg00VBPV975PgJ6Q03v6/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/mm10) with pre-defined mm10 reference genome.
* [AWS mm9](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/BKpvFg00VBPV975PgJ6Q03v6/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/mm9) with pre-defined mm9 reference genome.
* [Azure general](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/F6K911Q9xyfgJ36JFzv03Z5J/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/general) without pre-defined reference genome.
* [Azure hg38](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/F6K911Q9xyfgJ36JFzv03Z5J/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/hg38) with pre-defined hg38 reference genome.
* [Azure hg19](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/F6K911Q9xyfgJ36JFzv03Z5J/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/hg19) with pre-defined hg19 reference genome.
* [Azure mm10](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/F6K911Q9xyfgJ36JFzv03Z5J/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/mm10) with pre-defined mm10 reference genome.
* [Azure mm9](https://platform.DNAnexus.com/projects/F6K911Q9xyfgJ36JFzv03Z5J/data/ATAC-seq/workflows/v1.3.0/mm9) with pre-defined mm9 reference genome.

3. Click on the DX workflow `atac`.

4. Specify your input files (FASTQs, BAMs, TAG-ALIGNs, ...) on the top left. For example, click on the item "fastqs_rep1_R1" and choose your R1 FASTQ file for replicate 1. See details [here](input.md) for other input types.

5. Choose a reference genome. See details [here](input.md).

6. Click on "Run as Analysis..." and you will be automatically redirected to the "Monitor" tab.
